## 1. Company Profile:

IntelliTech Innovations is a cutting-edge technology company specialising in the development of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions and smart systems. They design and manufacture smart home devices, industrial 
IoT sensors, and provide cloud-based data analytics services. IntelliTech's innovative products are used in a wide range of applications, from home automation to industrial monitoring, and they collect and process a substantial amount of data. The company is committed to managing the risks associated with its IoT products and services effectively. 

## 2. Overview: 

IntelliTech Innovations recognises the importance of managing security and privacy risks associated with IoT and smart systems. They have initiated a qualitative risk assessment project based on ISO 27005 Annex  E to evaluate these risks comprehensively. This scenario revolves around their efforts to conduct a qualitative risk assessment in their domain.

## 3. Things to note: 

1. Scope: The risk assessment project encompasses the entire range of IoT products and services offered 
by IntelliTech, including devices, data storage, data analytics, and communication channels. 

2. Objective: The primary goal is to identify, assess, and prioritise information security and privacy risks in 
accordance with ISO 27005 Annex E. 

3. Team: A multidisciplinary team consisting of IoT engineers, data scientists, cybersecurity experts, and 
legal advisors will collaborate to conduct the assessment. 

4. Assets: Sensitive data collected by IoT devices, intellectual property, and customer trust are among the 
most critical assets IntelliTech seeks to safeguard. 


## 4. Your Task (and guide): 

Conduct a qualitative risk assessment as per the ISO 27005 Annex E guidelines, within the context of IoT 
and smart systems: 

1. Identify Assets: List and categorise the information assets and resources that are integral to IntelliTech's IoT products and services.

2. Identify Threats and Vulnerabilities: Identify/anticipate potential threats and vulnerabilities that could impact the identified assets. 
   
3. Determine Risk Likelihood and Impact: Utilising ISO 27005 Annex E guidelines, determine the likelihood and impact of each identified risk. Analyse how likely a threat is to occur and the potential consequences if it does. 

4. Assess Risk Severity: Evaluate and assign a severity level to each risk by considering the combination of  likelihood and impact. 

5. Prioritise Risks: Rank the risks based on their severity levels, with the goal of prioritising the allocation of resources for mitigation. 

6. Document Findings: Develop a clear and concise risk assessment report that documents the identified risks, their likelihood, impact, severity, and prioritisation. 

7. Recommend Mitigation Measures: Suggest potential mitigation measures and controls to address the identified risks. These should be tailored to the IoT and smart systems domain.


**Aim**: gain practical experience in applying the principles and guidelines outlined in ISO 27005 Annex E to conduct a qualitative risk assessment within the unique context of IoT and smart systems.
