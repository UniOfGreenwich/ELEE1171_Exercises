# Revision

~~~admonish info

Welcome to the revision companion for this module. 

This resource is designed to help you review key concepts through scenario-based questions, case studies, and applied multiple-choice items. 

Each section aligns with different parts of the syllabus and includes explanations to support deeper understanding of the underlying principles. 

Work through each quiz at your own pace and revisit areas where you feel less confident. 

Answers are reinforced with context to help clarify not just what is correct, but why.
