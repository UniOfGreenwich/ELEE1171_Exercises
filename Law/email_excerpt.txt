Subject: Concerns about privileged access outside office hours

Hi HR,

Apologies if this is not the right channel, but I wanted to formally raise a concern that I also mentioned informally last week.

Over the past two weekends, I noticed system access logs showing privileged activity outside our normal working hours — particularly late at night or early morning on Sundays. I know we’ve recently changed some roles and that admin credentials may be shared in some cases, but I find the timing odd.

While I can't confirm if this is misuse, I suggest checking whether any audit or usage reviews are already underway. I’m flagging it purely out of caution, not accusation.

Let me know if you’d like me to forward the log excerpts I reviewed.

Regards,  
Mark Jackson
